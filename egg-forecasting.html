    <h1>Forecasting Volatile Egg Prices for Procurement Planning</h1>

    <p>
      This project uses time-series forecasting to help Mister Smith’s, a local bakery in Vermillion, SD, manage the impact of volatile egg prices. After a sudden spike forced a $0.50 surcharge on egg-based dishes, the bakery needed a way to anticipate future price changes. By analyzing 30 years of monthly U.S. egg price data, the model delivers forward-looking insights to support better cost planning, supplier negotiations, and pricing decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Business Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Mister Smith’s relies heavily on egg-based ingredients. In late 2024, a price spike forced the bakery to apply a $0.50 surcharge on egg items. This triggered customer backlash and hurt margins. The bakery lacked visibility into upcoming price trends. It needed a way to forecast prices ahead of time and build inventory or pricing strategies proactively.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Business Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What will egg prices look like over the next 12 months?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>When are prices most likely to spike?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>What is the forecast range, and how can we plan for volatility?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Can the model support budgeting and supplier planning?</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Data was sourced from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) using:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nominal Egg Prices</strong>: Monthly U.S. city average (Grade A, Large)</li>
      <li><strong>Egg-Specific CPI</strong>: Used to inflation-adjust historical prices</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The resulting dataset covers Jan 1995 to Jan 2025 — 360+ monthly records with no missing values.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytical Approach</h2>
    <p>The model tested three forecasting approaches:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Naïve Model</li>
      <li>Exponential Smoothing (ETS)</li>
      <li><strong>ARIMA</strong> – selected for final deployment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ARIMA outperformed others on 2024 holdout data. It offered the best balance of accuracy and interpretability under recent volatility.

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Winter price spikes are consistent:</strong> December–January saw the highest median and most variable prices.</li>
      <li><strong>Recent volatility breaks the pattern:</strong> Forecast error increased in late 2024, underscoring post-pandemic instability.</li>
      <li><strong>ARIMA was most reliable:</strong> Despite noise, it offered the best generalizable performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Business Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Order early for Q4–Q1 to avoid spikes: plan bulk egg purchases in advance</li>
      <li>Use $3.40/dozen as a budgeting anchor for 2025–26</li>
      <li>If prices dip below $3.00, secure fixed-rate supply contracts</li>
      <li>If prices approach $4.50, prepare menu adjustments to protect margins</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assumptions & Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No external predictors (e.g., feed or fuel costs) were included</li>
      <li>Forecast assumes past trends continue — unexpected shocks may reduce accuracy</li>
      <li>Model selected by cross-validation: ARIMA(4,0,0)(2,0,0)[12] without differencing</li>
    </ul>
