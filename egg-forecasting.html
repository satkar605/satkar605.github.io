    <h1>Forecasting Volatile Egg Prices for Procurement Planning</h1>
    <p><strong>Client:</strong> Mister Smith’s Bakery – Vermillion, SD</p>

    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This project built a time-series forecasting model using 30 years of egg price data to help a local bakery anticipate cost swings. The goal was to reduce price-related disruptions, optimize ordering, and guide supplier negotiations through forward-looking insights.</p>

    <h2>Business Challenge</h2>
    <p>Mister Smith’s bakery experienced a sudden price spike in late 2024, which led to a $0.50 surcharge on egg-based dishes. This eroded customer trust and created operational instability. Without visibility into future prices, the business was left reactive. This project aimed to change that by enabling proactive pricing and procurement strategy.</p>

    <h2>Key Business Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What will egg prices look like over the next 12 months?</li>
      <li>When are seasonal price spikes most likely?</li>
      <li>How wide is the forecast range, and how should we plan around it?</li>
      <li>Is the model reliable enough to guide budgeting?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Summary</h2>
    <p>The model draws on publicly available data from the Federal Reserve (FRED), using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nominal Egg Prices:</strong> Monthly U.S. city average per dozen (Grade A, Large)</li>
      <li><strong>Egg-Specific CPI:</strong> Used to inflation-adjust historical prices</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This produced an inflation-adjusted time series covering Jan 1995 – Jan 2025 with no missing values, ideal for long-term forecasting.</p>

    <h2>Analytical Approach</h2>
    <p>The data was decomposed into trend, seasonality, and noise to assess structural shifts. A rolling validation approach compared:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Naïve model</li>
      <li>Exponential Smoothing (ETS)</li>
      <li>ARIMA – selected for final deployment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ARIMA outperformed others in forecasting 2024 test data. Though volatility remained high, it best balanced accuracy and explainability.</p>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Winter price spikes are consistent:</strong> December–January saw the highest median and most variable prices.</li>
      <li><strong>Recent volatility breaks the pattern:</strong> Forecast error increased in late 2024, underscoring post-pandemic instability.</li>
      <li><strong>ARIMA was most reliable:</strong> Despite noise, it offered the best generalizable performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Business Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Order early:</strong> Buy in Q4 ahead of expected winter spikes to avoid $0.80–$1.20/dozen cost jumps.</li>
      <li><strong>Use $3.40 as a planning anchor:</strong> Forecast stabilizes near this value through 2026.</li>
      <li><strong>Plan using forecast bands:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>If prices drop below $3.00 → lock contracts</li>
          <li>If prices rise above $4.50 → adjust inventory or pricing early</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Minimize abrupt surcharges:</strong> Use forecast to phase-in pricing decisions and preserve customer loyalty.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assumptions & Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Only internal historical price data was used — no external predictors (e.g., disease, transportation).</li>
      <li>Stationarity test suggested differencing, but best ARIMA model did not apply it (ARIMA(4,0,0)(2,0,0)[12]).</li>
      <li>Forecast assumes past patterns will repeat — unexpected shocks reduce accuracy.</li>
    </ul>
