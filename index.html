  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm the analyst who asks <strong>"why" five times</strong> and won't stop until complex problems become clear, actionable solutions. My journey into analytics began through <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>: co-founding a music streaming platform taught me that behind every business decision is a story the data can tell.</p>
  <p>I am currently pursuing my <strong>M.S. in Business Analytics</strong> at the University of South Dakota, where I also serve as <strong>President of the USD Business Analytics Club</strong>. Under my leadership, the club has grown to over 40 members and partnered with local businesses to develop practical data-driven solutions. In a recent forecasting project, I helped a bakery secure more favorable supplier contracts, allowing them to maintain pricing without passing increased costs to customers.</p>
  <p>My unique combination of entrepreneurial experience, technical expertise across <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, visualization tools, and exceptional communication skills allows me to translate complex analytical findings into compelling business narratives. Whether presenting to executives or teaching fellow students, I excel at making the technical accessible and the complex simple.</p>
  <p>I'm seeking <strong>entry-level business analyst or analytics engineering roles</strong> where I can apply my evidence-based approach to solve meaningful problems in supply chain, marketing intelligence, or product analytics—with the ultimate goal of leading analytical teams that drive strategic business decisions.</p>
